Here is a basic site I made in Cloud9 as my Senior Project in Cloud9.

Users can upload messages to a newest-first ticker feed. Other users can filter the types of postings they would like to see. Every insert, the server makes sure that no more than 100 postings exist under each category. If there are, it trims old postings down to 100. An admin page exists for manually removing postings.
